# Self Introduction
Hello! My name is **Qinggang Li**, but you can also call me **Richard**. 
I am a *MAPPSS* student concentrating on *political science*.
I am born and raised in *China*. I recived my undergraduate degree from *University of Toronto*.
My research interest is in *politics of capitalism*.

In my spare time, I enjoy the following activites:
1. *GAMING*
2. *Piano*
3. *Reading* 

Here is a photo of me: ![A photo of me](https://github.com/QGL97/myrepo/blob/master/WechatIMG63.jpeg)

You can [find me on Github](https://github.com/QGL97) as well!

**Regarding this homework**, I found it **very hard** at first. I had to catch up very quickly, as I got into this class two weeks after the class began. I spended an afternoon only trying to figure out how *R* and *Git* work. And I had trouble *figuring out how to edit .md profile.* But with the help of my girlfriend, who is a data science major, and my roommate, who is a computer science major, I finally got through. I guess every beginning is difficult, but *practice makes perfect*. **I think I am beginning to like it!**
